# imagefap-dl-cli

## what is it?
This tool is forked from an existing project which is purposed to allow quick and easy downloading of user uploaded galleries on imagefap.com and xhamster.com
*Original Project: https://sourceforge.net/projects/imagefap-gallery-downloader/*

## why?
The original tool required you to visit the site and copy the links in to your clipboard. I didn't want to fudge with getting Python setup on my Windows machine and preferred to use a headless machine.

## differences
Currently you can provide URLs to the script via arguments (./IFLoad.py "url1" "url2" "url3") or by passing the "-f" option and specifying a text file that contains URLs on their own line.
